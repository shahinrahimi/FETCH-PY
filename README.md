# FETCH-PY
The FETCH-PY repository contains scripts and tools to automate the FETCH (Fluorescence Expression Through Cell Harvesting) analysis process for FCS (Flow Cytometry Standard) data files.

## Summary
This repository aims to streamline the analysis workflow, which includes quality data checks, applying various gating procedures, and calculating the FETCH score. The automation supports contour-based gating, standard deviation gating, and quadrant gating. The final FETCH score is saved to a CSV file, and potential issues with data integrity are flagged. The repository also includes options for generating PDF outputs of the gating steps to assist in debugging and result verification.
